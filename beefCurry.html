    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Clean and cut beef into cube shaped pieces (preferably soup cut).</li>
        <li>Transfer it to a pressure cooker and add salt, pepper powder, and a little water (enough to cover the meat). Pressure cook for 3 whistles and then remove the cooker from the flame. Allow it to rest until the pressure goes off. Keep aside.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a pan and splutter mustard seeds. Add sliced onions, green chilies, curry leaves, and a little salt. Saute until onions become translucent.</li>
        <li>Make a paste of ginger and garlic and add this paste to the pan and mix well.</li> 
        <li>Add chopped tomatoes and place the lid on the pan to cook on a low flame until it turns mushy.</li>
        <li>Add spice powders; chili, coriander, turmeric, pepper, and meat masala, and mix well. Make sure you turn the heat to low while adding the spice powders, so that they do not burn.</li>
        <li>Remove the lid from the pressure cooker and transfer the beef with the remaining water to the pan, mix well with the masala and cook on a medium flame for 5 – 8 minutes. Stir the curry carefully while cooking.</li>
        <li>Cook until gravy thickens, taste and add salt as needed. Garnish with coriander leaves and allow it to rest for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve with Naan/Bread, Malabar Paratha / Kerala porotta, or rice.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>You can vary the amount of chili and pepper to suit your spice level.</li>
        <li>The meat masala I have used in my recipe has been bought from an Indian store (Sakthi meat masala). You can also use a homemade masala which is preferable.</li>
    </ul>
